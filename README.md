# Lsb-Steganographie-coloredImage
Steganographie colored Image with lsb

to use this image change the image file for hid_pic and newImage 

# Number of bits

variable bit determine how much bit will it store the image

# Function code is to hide the secret image in source 

we take the strongest bit from the secret and put them in the weakest bits in source 

# Function decode is to show the secret image in source 

we create an empty array with size of image and loop inside the source image and take the number of bits from the weakest and put them in highsest bits 
in the new array and then we show the result
